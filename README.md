# temporal-glare
This is an attempt to improve the implementation of the paper "Temporal Glare: Real‚ÄêTime Dynamic Simulation of the Scattering in the Human Eye" by using various local and global tone mapping operators. 

A short demo movie could be found at the following link: 
TBD

The current implementation requires:
OpenCL
clFFT library
TinyEXR library
